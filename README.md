# mini-adventure-v1
Choose your own adventure...version 1

This is a choose your own adventure web application in the neo-noir genre. 
In this story, you are walking home from work at night when you see something shiny. 
The choices you make from there will take you on one of 15 paths.

The overarching theme is how the small choices we make can have a profound effect on the lives of others.

On the technical side of this app, the story is stored in MongoDB Atlas (using AWS) and displayed on the frontend 
using Embedded JavaScript (EJS). Express and Node are used in the backend. I suppose that makes this… a MEEN stack…?

Hosted on Render (link in the About section).
